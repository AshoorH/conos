\title{Save Conos object on disk to read it from ScanPy}
\usage{
saveConosForScanPy(con, output.path, metadata.df = NULL, norm = FALSE,
  pseudo.pca = FALSE, pca = FALSE, n.dims = 100, embed = FALSE,
  connect = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{conos object}

\item{output.path}{path to a folder, where intermediate files will be saved}

\item{metadata.df}{data.frame with additional metadata with rownames corresponding to cell ids, which should be passed to ScanPy.
If NULL, only information about cell ids and origin dataset will be saved.}

\item{norm}{logical, whether to include the matrix of normalised counts (only raw counts saved by default)}

\item{pseudo.pca}{logical, to produce an emulated PCA, Conos embeds the graph to a space with `n.dims` dimensions and saves it as a pseudoPCA}

\item{pca}{logical, whether to include PCA of all the samples (not batch corrected)}

\item{n.dims}{number of dimensions for calculating PCA and/or pseudoPCA}

\item{embed}{logical, whether to include the current conos embedding}

\item{connect}{logical, whether to include graph connectivities and distances}

\item{verbose}{print more messages}
